# ASL-WatchFace

This is a Pebble watchface example that adapts to fit Aplite, Basalt, and Chalk Pebble platforms. It was created for Austin Spark Leauge 2016 (http://sparkleague.co). The only working branch at the moment is the Master branch.

Feel free to use it in your projects if you find it useful. Just be sure to include the SparkLeague link (http://sparkleague.co) in the read.me file.
